I teach asset pricing theory to PhD students in the Jones School and the Department of Economics, data-driven finance to students in the Masters of Data Science program in the Department of Computer Science, and AI-assisted finance to MBA students in the Jones School.  Before joining Rice, I served on the faculties of Northwestern University, Indiana University, Washington University in St. Louis, and Texas A&M University.  I served as Senior Associate Dean at the Olin School at Washington University in St. Louis.  I am currently an associate editor of the Journal of Finance, and I'm a former editor of the Review of Financial Studies, a former editor of Finance & Stochastics, and a former associate editor of various other academic journals in economics and finance.  I've written two textbooks and numerous articles in the leading finance and economics journals.

I have served as the Finance Ph.D. Coordinator for the Jones School since 2009.  Currently, I am also the Finance Group Coordinator.
Recently, I've been doing research on disclosure policies, optimal contracting, security market design, and information asymmetry in option markets and advising several strong Ph.D. students.
