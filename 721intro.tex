\centerline{\textbf{Intro to BUSI 721}}
\vskip\baselineskip

The topics we will cover in this course are traditional for an introductory finance course.  We will start with the time value of money, then discuss different asset classes and their risks and returns, then discuss how to form efficient portfolios of assets, and finally discuss the financial analysis of corporate investment projects.  I'm going to assume that you have a better technical background than the typical business student, and I will take advantage of that to provide a deeper treatment of these traditional topics.  

We'll use numpy, pandas, matrix algebra, and even quadratic programming.  I'll explain these tools as we use them, and the course will be liberally sprinkled with code snippets that you can modify for assignments.  By the end of the course, you will know how stock and bond markets work, how to grab price data from the web to compute returns and analyze them, and you will have learned many other financial concepts and how to analyze and implement them in python or Excel.
